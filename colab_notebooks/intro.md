## Brief Intro

The `end-to-end-dog-vision` notebook contains code for building, training, and testing a model built upon MobileNetV2. No data augmentation or fine tuning is performed.

Future notebooks added to this folder will implement next steps, including but not limited to the techniques mentioned above, along with trying different models and evaluation metrics.
